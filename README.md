Understanding the Calculations
This is the most important section for understanding how the BVA tool works. Many of the financial benefits are
derived from these core calculations.
üßÆ Step 1: Working Hours Calculation
Purpose: Establishes the baseline for FTE cost calculations
Formula:
Total Working Days = (Weeks per Year √ó Days per Week) - Holiday/Sick Days
Working Hours per FTE per Year = Total Working Days √ó Hours per Day
Example:
- 52 weeks/year √ó 5 days/week = 260 potential working days
- 260 days - 25 holiday/sick days = 235 actual working days
- 235 days √ó 8 hours/day = 1,880 working hours per FTE per year
Why This Matters: This determines how much of an FTE's time and cost can be allocated to alert/incident
management.
üö® Step 2: Alert Cost Calculation
Purpose: Determines the true cost per alert based on FTE time allocation
Formula:
Total Alert Time per Year = Alert Volume √ó Average Triage Time (minutes)
Total Alert Hours per Year = Total Alert Time √∑ 60
Total Available FTE Hours = Alert FTEs √ó Working Hours per FTE per Year
FTE Time % on Alerts = Total Alert Hours √∑ Total Available FTE Hours
Page 9
Total Alert Handling Cost = (Alert FTEs √ó Average Salary) √ó FTE Time % on Alerts
Cost per Alert = Total Alert Handling Cost √∑ Alert Volume
Example:
- 500,000 alerts/year √ó 15 minutes = 7,500,000 minutes
- 7,500,000 √∑ 60 = 125,000 hours/year
- 3 FTEs √ó 1,880 hours = 5,640 available hours
- 125,000 √∑ 5,640 = 2,215% (meaning you need more FTEs!)
- If you had 67 FTEs: 125,000 √∑ (67 √ó 1,880) = 99% time allocation
- 67 FTEs √ó $60,000 salary √ó 99% = $3,980,400 total cost
- $3,980,400 √∑ 500,000 alerts = $7.96 per alert
Key Insight: If the FTE time percentage exceeds 100%, you need more staff or your estimates are incorrect.
üîß Step 3: Incident Cost Calculation
Purpose: Same logic as alerts, but for incidents
Formula: (Identical to alert calculation, using incident-specific inputs)
Cost per Incident = [(Incident FTEs √ó Salary √ó Time Allocation %)] √∑ Incident Volume
Example:
- 50,000 incidents/year √ó 45 minutes = 2,250,000 minutes
- 2,250,000 √∑ 60 = 37,500 hours/year
Page 10
- 20 FTEs √ó 1,880 hours = 37,600 available hours
- 37,500 √∑ 37,600 = 99.7% time allocation
- 20 FTEs √ó $70,000 √ó 99.7% = $1,395,800 total cost
- $1,395,800 √∑ 50,000 = $27.92 per incident
üí∞ Step 4: Savings Calculations
Alert Reduction Savings
Purpose: Cost savings from reducing alert volume
Formula:
Avoided Alerts = Alert Volume √ó (Alert Reduction % √∑ 100)
Alert Reduction Savings = Avoided Alerts √ó Cost per Alert
Example:
- 500,000 alerts √ó 30% reduction = 150,000 avoided alerts
- 150,000 √ó $7.96 = $1,194,000 annual savings
Alert Triage Time Savings
Purpose: Additional savings from processing remaining alerts faster
Formula:
Remaining Alerts = Alert Volume - Avoided Alerts
Remaining Alert Cost = Remaining Alerts √ó Cost per Alert
Alert Triage Savings = Remaining Alert Cost √ó (Triage Time Reduction % √∑ 100)
Example:
- 500,000 - 150,000 = 350,000 remaining alerts
- 350,000 √ó $7.96 = $2,786,000 remaining cost
- $2,786,000 √ó 25% efficiency = $696,500 additional savings
Page 11
Incident Savings (Same Logic)
Incident Reduction Savings = (Incident Volume √ó Reduction %) √ó Cost per Incident
Incident Triage Savings = (Remaining Incidents √ó Cost per Incident) √ó Efficiency %
Major Incident Savings
Purpose: Cost savings from faster resolution of critical incidents
Formula:
MTTR Hours Saved per Incident = Current MTTR √ó (Improvement % √∑ 100)
Total MTTR Hours Saved = Major Incident Volume √ó MTTR Hours Saved per Incident
Major Incident Savings = Total MTTR Hours Saved √ó Cost per Hour
Example:
- 8 hours current MTTR √ó 40% improvement = 3.2 hours saved per incident
- 120 major incidents √ó 3.2 hours = 384 hours saved annually
- 384 hours √ó $10,000/hour = $3,840,000 annual savings
üßÆ Step 5: Total Annual Benefits
Purpose: Sum all savings categories
Formula:
Total Annual Benefits =
Alert Reduction Savings +
Alert Triage Savings +
Incident Reduction Savings +
Incident Triage Savings +
Major Incident Savings +
Tool Savings +
People Efficiency Gains +
FTE Avoidance +
SLA Penalty Avoidance +
Revenue Growth +
CAPEX Savings +
OPEX Savings
Page 12
üìä Step 6: Implementation Timeline Impact
Purpose: Model when benefits are actually realized
Benefit Realization Factor
Formula:
If Month ‚â§ Implementation Delay: Factor = 0%
If Implementation Delay < Month ‚â§ (Implementation Delay + Ramp-up):
Factor = (Month - Implementation Delay) √∑ Ramp-up Period
If Month > (Implementation Delay + Ramp-up): Factor = 100%
Example (6-month implementation, 3-month ramp-up):
- Months 1-6: 0% benefits (still implementing)
- Month 7: 33% benefits (1 month into 3-month ramp-up)
- Month 8: 67% benefits (2 months into ramp-up)
- Month 9+: 100% benefits (full realization)
Monthly Cash Flow
Formula:
Page 13
Monthly Benefit = (Annual Benefits √∑ 12) √ó Realization Factor
Monthly Platform Cost = Annual Platform Cost √∑ 12
Monthly Net Cash Flow = Monthly Benefit - Monthly Platform Cost
(Plus one-time services cost in Year 1)
üíπ Step 7: Financial Metrics
Net Present Value (NPV)
Purpose: Value of future cash flows in today's money.
Formula:
NPV = Œ£ [Net Cash Flow Year n √∑ (1 + Discount Rate)^n]
Example (3-year evaluation, 10% discount rate):
Year 1: $500,000 √∑ (1.10)¬π = $454,545
Year 2: $1,200,000 √∑ (1.10)¬≤ = $991,736
Year 3: $1,200,000 √∑ (1.10)¬≥ = $901,578
NPV = $454,545 + $991,736 + $901,578 = $2,347,859
Return on Investment (ROI)
Formula:
Total Investment = Sum of all platform and services costs
ROI = NPV √∑ Total Investment √ó 100%
Example:
Page 14
NPV = $2,347,859
Total Investment = $800,000
ROI = $2,347,859 √∑ $800,000 √ó 100% = 293.5%
Payback Period
Purpose: When cumulative cash flow turns positive
Monthly Calculation:
For each month:
Cumulative Cash Flow += Monthly Net Cash Flow
If Cumulative Cash Flow ‚â• 0: Payback achieved
üîÑ Step 8: Scenario Adjustments
Conservative Scenario
- Annual Benefits √ó 0.7 (30% lower)
- Implementation Delay √ó 1.3 (30% longer)
- Ramp-up period unchanged
Optimistic Scenario
- Annual Benefits √ó 1.2 (20% higher)
- Implementation Delay √ó 0.8 (20% shorter)
- Ramp-up period unchanged
üöÄ Step 9: FTE Equivalency Calculation
Purpose: Convert operational savings to equivalent headcount
Formula:
Total Operational Savings = Alert + Incident + Major Incident Savings
Average FTE Salary = (Alert FTE Salary + Incident FTE Salary) √∑ 2
Equivalent FTEs = Total Operational Savings √∑ Average FTE Salary
Example:
Total Operational Savings = $2,500,000
Average FTE Salary = ($60,000 + $70,000) √∑ 2 = $65,000
Equivalent FTEs = $2,500,000 √∑ $65,000 = 38.5 FTEs
Page 15
Interpretation: The solution saves the equivalent of 38.5 full-time employees' worth of operational costs annually.
‚ö†Ô∏è Common Calculation Pitfalls
1. FTE Time Allocation Over 100%
Problem: More work than available hours Solution: Either increase FTE count or reduce volume/time estimates
2. Unrealistic Improvement Percentages
Problem: 80%+ reduction claims Solution: Use industry benchmarks (typically 20-50% improvements)
3. Double-Counting Benefits
Problem: Including the same savings in multiple categories Solution: Clearly define what each category covers
4. Ignoring Implementation Reality
Problem: Assuming immediate 100% benefits Solution: Always include realistic ramp-up periods
5. Inconsistent Time Periods
Problem: Mixing monthly and annual figures Solution: Ensure all calculations use consistent time units
üîç Validation Checklist
Before finalizing your model, verify:
Page 16
FTE time allocation is realistic (ideally 60-90% for operational roles)
Cost per alert/incident makes sense (compare to industry benchmarks)
Total annual benefits are achievable (not more than 50% of current operational costs)
Implementation timeline is realistic (typically 6-12 months for complex solutions)
Conservative scenario still shows positive ROI (risk mitigation)
All calculations use consistent units (annual figures, same currency)
